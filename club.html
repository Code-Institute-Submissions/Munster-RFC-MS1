                <h5>History</h5>
					<p>Munster was officially founded in 1879, at the same time as Leinster and Ulster, with Connacht
						being founded
						ten years later in 1889. The first Interprovincial matches between Leinster, Ulster and Munster,
						however, were
						held in 1875. The founding of the Munster branch of the IRFU was intended to organise and
						oversee the game within
						the province and prevent any club bias by providing neutral selectors for the representative
						side. In amateur days, the four Irish provinces played against each other in the IRFU
						Interprovincial Championship and also played touring international sides.
						Munster traditionally drew its strength from the clubs of Limerick, with the game popular in the
						city and widely
						played at all levels. Teams such as Shannon, Garryowen and Young Munster built up fierce
						rivalries with one
						another, helping push standards in the province higher as a result.[5][6]</p>
