#### Strategy

My aim in the design was to keep the home page simplistic with a captivating image to get fans/users attention
immediately.I also wanted the user to be able to naviagte the site very easily and have it as user-friendly as possible.

#### Scope

For users, I wanted to provide them with as much info about Munster RFC as possible.
I also wanted to add options for merchandise (through a link).Plus i wanted to have images that the uses would
want to view of matches and the club in general. As the stadium is located on google maps I felt a direct link to google
maps would be appropriate here.

#### Structure

In the home page I wanted a image that would draw the attention of the user immediately. I also wanted a naviagation bar that is easily useable,
and can get you to the rest of the site without much effort.
In the history section I wanted to detail some of the clubs most iconics matches/players.
I also wanted to add a gallery of current and past players.
In the matches section I wanted to inform the user about past games and upcoming fixtures.
Plus have a link to buy tickets and merchandise. 
In the footer of each page i wanted to have links to the clubs social media accounts.
